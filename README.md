# TEAM 5 - Game Project 2

## Looking to test things out in Unity? Look no further!

### Everyone has their own personal folder setup in the assets folder where you can do anything you want. Make a new branch preferebly called "YourInitials_ShaderWorkExample". So basically, your initials, underscore, what you're working on. Once whatever you are working on is considered finished, we will implement into the main scene.

### Having merge conflicts? Well no problem! Contact Joakim or Andreas from programming and we'll figure it out.

### Not sure how to get the project up and running on your computer? Also contact Andreas/Joakim!

### Don't merge a pull request before a programmer has looked at it. We'll merge it for you.
