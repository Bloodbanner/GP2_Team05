# TEAM 5 - Game Project 2

## Looking to test things out in Unity? Look no further!

### Everyone has their own personal folder setup in the assets folder. Make a new branch preferebly called "YourInitials_ShaderWorkExample". So basically, your initials, underscore, what you're working on.

### Having merge conflicts? Well no problem! Contact Joakim or Andreas from programming and we'll figure it out.

### Not sure how to get the project up and running on your computer? Also contact Andreas/Joakim!
